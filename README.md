You can run the project inside your browser [here](https://pazdedan.github.io/Acacia-OS).


This is the small 'operating system' I created in Scratch, and later TurboWarp.


Summary of the main changes between versions:

v0,2 - First version to give access to the desktop

v0,7 - Two apps can be opened side-by-side.

v1,4 - Four (or more if you change the launch code) apps can be opened side-by-side. This also created the need to revamp the launcher, and to add a multitasking panel.

v1,7 - Last 'classic' version.

v1,8 - New setup (uncomplete). New UI design (only present in Setup). Multitasking overhaul, now uses window bar (some controls missing).

v1,9 - Screen uses 16:9 ratio instead of 4:3 (most of the UI is cut). In-built game. Registry added. File system created (max. 100 seperate files).

v2,0 - New UI implemented across most of the system. Apps are either modernised, or have modern counterparts created.
